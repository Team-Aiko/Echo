## 🚀 **Introduction**
Welcome to **Echo**, a next-generation Discord bot that goes beyond simple automation. Designed with **security-first principles**, Echo is built to protect, engage, and enhance your community experience.

### 🔥 **Why Security is Our Top Priority**
Unlike many bots that **only focus on functionality**, Echo is designed to ensure **your server remains protected from attacks, spam, and malicious activity.** 

🔹 **Overkill security? Maybe. Necessary? Absolutely.** Most attacks aren’t random—they’re targeted. **We don’t just stop casual rule breakers; we prepare for real threats.**

🔹 **Why we don’t reveal everything:** Some aspects of Echo’s security system are **not public** for a reason. If a bot’s defenses are fully explained, attackers can find ways to bypass them. Security isn’t just about having defenses—it’s about keeping them unpredictable.

⚠ **Bots are NOT a replacement for human moderation.** Always combine automated security with **trusted admins.**

## 🔐 **Encryption & Why It’s Important**
### 🔹 **What’s Encrypted?**
✅ **Bot Token** (Prevents unauthorized access)
✅ **Guild ID & Client ID** (Stops misuse & impersonation)
✅ **Stored Securely** – **NEVER written in plaintext**

🔒 **We don’t expose details about our encryption methods**—this ensures our security systems **stay unpredictable to potential attackers.**

### ✅ **How to Securely Store Your Credentials**
```bash
python secure_storage.py setup  # Generates encryption key
python secure_storage.py encrypt # Encrypts bot credentials
```
🔹 Follow the prompts to enter **your bot token, guild ID, and client ID.**
🔹 Credentials are encrypted and stored securely.

### 🔓 **How to Decrypt and Run the Bot**
```bash
python secure_storage.py decrypt  # Decrypts credentials securely
python main.py                     # Runs the bot with secure access
```
✔ **Only the authorized system** can decrypt the credentials.
✔ **Decryption happens in memory**—your credentials are NEVER stored in plaintext.

## 🔧 **Maximizing Security**
To ensure maximum protection:
```bash
1️⃣ Set up a `#mod-logs` channel for security alerts.
2️⃣ Ensure the bot has proper permissions to monitor and take action.
3️⃣ Regularly update the bot for the latest security improvements.
4️⃣ Fine-tune detection settings to balance security & usability.
```
